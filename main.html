The system on the right has [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnoidal_wave, cnoidal]
attractors -- providing $\varepsilon$ is not too large
(around 1/16 is OK). Small $\varepsilon$ allows the KdV dynamics to dominate, so that
tall pulses are narrow. Narrow pulses are penalized by $u_{xx}$ term,
thus the loss increases as pulse amplitude grows---which tends to stabilize the
system.

Parameter $b$ sets the ratio between the gain (from the $u$ on the RHS) and 
loss ($u_{xx}$) -- and thus the amplitude of the cnoidal steady state.

The integral constraint (that $u$ has zero mean) prevents a low frequency 
instability (there is gain, but no loss at DC). 
In the code the F.T. of $u$ (i.e., v) is simply zeroed at each step.

Note also that there is an instability at the Nyquist wavenumber. Not sure why.
Perhaps there is less loss from $u_{xx}$ at that frequency because the system 
is discrete in $x$. Fix by setting v(N/2+1)=0 in code below.

With $\varepsilon=1/16$ and $b=0.2$ the system (after simulating (elsewhere, in Octave) from
a random I.C. to $t\approx 2000$ with h=2e-6) appears attracted to a 2-cnoidal 
solution with peak pulse amplitudes of approximately 25 and 60. *See below*.

With large $\epsilon$ (say $\epsilon=16$) the system seems to converge rapidly
to a steady-state, but is ultimately unstable. I think this is because
the KdV dynamics cannot sharpen the signal sufficiently quickly for
the $u_{xx}$ term to provide a stabilizing influence.
